Many Web sites are devoted to anime. Anime is the prevalent style in Japanese comic books or manga . In Japan, the comic book is a popular form of entertainment for adults as well as for younger audiences. Story lines are often very sophisticated and complex and extend into episodic series. Typical anime themes or genres include Ninja and other martial arts; the supernatural or horror story; the romance; and science fiction including robots and space ships. Foils for the main characters, including robots, monsters, or just plain bad people, often lack the doe-eyed quality. Variations of anime called hentai and ecchai are sexually-oriented. Doujinshi is the term for "autonomous comics," or comics written and distributed by independent and often amateur devotees of anime. -TechTarget Contributor [2005-04-15]</div><div id=gif1><div class=first-picture><img alt="image of a girl making two shite hearts" class=widths_media src=img/anime.gif width=600></div></div><div class=sources><p id=bottom>sources:</div><div class=kalla-1><p>Whatis.Techraget (2005) anime <a href=https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/anime class=link-sources>whatis.techtarget.com</a> [2022-03-22]</div>
