On his deathbed, his grandfather instills two powerful messages within Yuji: "always help others" and "die surrounded by people." Yuji's friends at the Occult Club attract Curses to their school when they unsealed a rotten finger talisman which Yuji swallowed to protect Megumi Fushiguro and their friends, becoming host to a powerful curse named Ryomen Sukuna. Due to Sukuna's evil nature, all sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and by extension, Yuji) immediately. But upon seeing Yuji retaining control over his body, Megumi's teacher Satoru Gojo brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School with a proposal to his superiors: postpone Yuji's death sentence and train under Goto until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers so the Curse can be completely destroyed. At the same time, a group of cursed spirits plot a multi-layered attack on the world of jujutsu sorcery, including the cursed spirit Mahito, whose "Idle Transfiguration" can reshape the soul of any human, and a disgruntled sorcerer named Suguru Geto, who was assumed to have died a year ago. At the exchange event between the Tokyo and Kyoto jujutsu schools, some want Yuji dead immediately, while others side with Gojo to keep him alive. Gojo and Geto failed to protect a young girl from Toji Fushiguro, Megumi's father, an assassin from the Zenin clan. Geto decides the world must be cleansed of non-sorcerers so no more cursed spirits can manifest. The disfigured Kyoto Jujutsu Tech second-year student Kokichi Muta is revealed to be a mole. Geto and the cursed spirits lay a screen over Shibuya. Various sorcerers arrive at the scene to fight them. Gojo fights off cursed spirits and destroys Hanami, but sealed away in Prison Realm. The event also confirms that Geto is death his corpse possessed by an ancient sorcerer named Kenjaku. Yuji and their allies face Kenjaku's forces with both sides suffering losses, Gojo still trapped. As the incident ends, Kenjaku reveals that he has been jumping from body to body for thousands of years and implanted Binding Vows, which in turn awakens thousands of new sorcerers throughout Japan including Tsumiki. He then releases many curses onto Japan, the first step into creating chaos and a world of cursed spirits like the Heian period. In the aftermath, Yuji and Megumi team up with second-year Yuta Okkotsu and Yuki Tsukumo, a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and one of the most powerful sorcerers of all time along with Choso and second-year student Maki Zenin to meet with Tengen. Tengen, an immortal, part-curse part-human jujutsu sorcerer, reveals Kenjaku's plan to merge Tengen's consciousness with Japan's human population. The Culling Game, Kenjaku's all-out war between the sorcerers and curse users of Japan, then begins.

But when he learns from Kite, an apprentice of his father Ging Freecss, that he is still alive and has since become an accomplished Hunter, Gon leaves his home on Whale Island (くじら島, Kujira Tō) to take the Hunter Examination (ハンター試験, Hantā Shiken) in order to become a Hunter like him.[9][10][11] During the exam, Gon meets and befriends three of the other applicants: Kurapika, the last remaining member of the Kurta clan who wishes to become a Hunter in order to avenge his clan and recover their scarlet-glowing eyes that were plucked from their corpses by a band of thieves known as the Phantom Troupe; Leorio, a prospective physician who, in order to pay for medical school, desires the financial benefits that Hunters receive; and Killua Zoldyck, another twelve-year-old boy who has left his former life as a member of the world's most notorious assassin family.[10][11][3] Among many other examinees, Gon continuously encounters Hisoka, a mysterious and deadly transmuter who takes an interest in him.
